# Sorting Algorithms - Merge and Quick Sort

Although it is a simple implementation of sorting algorithms, given to me as a class assignment, I felt very good about it and its application as it uses generic programming, abstract data types/interfaces, implements both total and natural ordering and you can use other kind of readymade comparators to sort. Also, I could readily implement some of my other school assignments into it.
